# Party List'o

*Update: this project does no longer work due to Last.fm removing Events from their api*

A 24h hack presented in the Music Hack Day in Barcelona, 2013.
It will create a playlist of songs for a Last.fm event based on the tastes of people attending, so if you are a DJ or band going to play there you can better congratulate your audience :)

For the tech freaks, everything is done client-side accessing Last.fm API with Javascript.
